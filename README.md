# Ops Narrative Studio

**Purpose:**  
Turn operational documentation, audits, or workflows into human-sounding thought-leadership essays—then run those drafts through an AI editor that scores tone, structure, and storytelling depth.

This bundle includes two modular Custom GPTs:

---

## 1. Ops Narrative Generator GPT (v2)

**Goal:** Convert structured operational documentation (FinOps, DevOps, ContentOps, etc.) into compelling public narratives.  
**Key Features:**
- Converts process docs → Substack/LinkedIn essays
- Builds story arc (context → insight → resolution)
- Runs a “Humanization Sub-Routine” for natural pacing, phrasing, and rhythm
- Supports modes for Substack essay, LinkedIn post, or before/after comparison

**Recommended Input:**
- Internal wiki excerpts, FinOps workflows, audit reports, enablement guides

**Example Prompt:**
> “Transform this content pipeline audit into a 900-word Substack essay with natural voice and three takeaways.”

---

## 2. Ops Narrative Critic GPT

**Goal:** Evaluate and refine narratives generated by the Generator GPT.  
**Key Features:**
- Scores across five dimensions: Storytelling Arc, Clarity, Strategic Depth, Tone Alignment, Readability  
- Provides a numeric table (1–10 scale) and concise rewrite recommendations  
- Detects “consultant voice,” stiff phrasing, and tone drift  
- Includes Compare Mode for LinkedIn vs Substack fit

**Example Prompt:**
> “Score this Substack draft for tone alignment and strategic depth, and recommend fixes.”
